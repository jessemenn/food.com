# food.com
ingredients scraped from food.com

## Structure
Each entry is multiple lines:
URL
title
ingredient1
ingredient2
ingredientN

## Notes
I scraped food.com's recipe index, iirc, about .5 million entries. Some are BS ("handtwipes" and "ice cubes"), but it was a large enough set that I hoped it'd be okay. For whatver reason, I only kept the ingredients, not the actual quantity, which sort of sucks in retrospect. If anyone does something with this, I'd love to know about it. Drop me a line.
